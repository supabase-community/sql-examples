## Table with Foreign Key

Add foreign key to product_id using `references`.

`on delete cascade` When a referenced foreign key is deleted, all rows referencing that key are deleted, respectively.

`on update cascade` When a referenced foreign key is updated, all rows referencing that key are updated, respectively.

```sql
create table table_name (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  product_id uuid references products (id) on delete cascade on update cascade,
  data jsonb,
  name text
);
```
